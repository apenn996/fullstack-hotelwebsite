  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

  <h4>1. What is a hotel management system, and how does it affect my reservation?</h4>
  <p>A hotel management system is the behind-the-scenes software that helps hotels manage reservations, check-ins, and various other operations. As a guest, you might not interact directly with it, but it ensures a smooth booking experience and efficient check-ins and check-outs.</p>

  <h4>2. How can I make a reservation using the hotel's online system?</h4>
  <p>To make a reservation, you can visit the hotel's website or use a booking platform. Select your check-in and check-out dates, choose your room type, and provide your details. The hotel's management system handles your reservation, ensuring the room is available and ready for your stay.</p>

  <h4>3. What if I need to change or cancel my reservation?</h4>
  <p>If you need to modify or cancel your reservation, you can usually do so through the hotel's website or by contacting their customer support. The hotel management system will update the availability of rooms accordingly, making changes hassle-free.</p>

  <h4>4. Can I request specific room preferences, such as a non-smoking room or a room with a view?</h4>
  <p>Yes, during the reservation process, you can often specify your room preferences. The hotel management system will do its best to accommodate your requests, but availability depends on factors like room availability and the hotel's policies.</p>

  <h4>5. How do I know if my reservation is confirmed, and will I receive a confirmation email?</h4>
  <p>Your reservation is typically confirmed when you receive a confirmation email after making a booking. The hotel management system generates these emails to provide you with all the details of your reservation, including your booking reference and stay information.</p>

  <h4>6. What if I encounter issues with my reservation or have special requests?</h4>
  <p>If you encounter any issues or have special requests, you can reach out to the hotel's customer support. They can assist you with any concerns, including requests for room upgrades or addressing any unexpected changes in your plans.</p>

  <h4>7. Can I view and manage my reservation details online, such as check-in and check-out times?</h4>

  <h4>8. How is my payment handled, and is it secure?</h4>
  <p>Your payment is typically processed securely through the hotel's website. They use encryption and secure payment gateways to protect your financial information. The hotel management system ensures the billing process is accurate and reliable.</p>

  <h4>9. What happens if I arrive late for my reservation or encounter unexpected delays?</h4>
