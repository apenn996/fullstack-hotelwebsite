This website is a hotel management website where users can manage(create, update, view) an account and reserve hotel rooms. There are a variety of hotels with their own amenities, prices, and more. There is also an employee only portal where different tiers of employees can log in and change backend information depending on their account type. Some information such as the hotels themselves and user's reservations can be chaned or deleted depending on employee permission levels. 
All hotel and user data is stored in a database and loaded into the website dynamically.
